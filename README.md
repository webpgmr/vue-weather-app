# phonebook

> Little Phonebook app as Vue example using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader)

## Installation

After cloning change into the clone directory and do

``` sh
npm install
cp src/config.dist.hson src/config.hson
npm run dev
```

Now just point your browser to (http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/) to start the app in dev mode.

You can also configure saving and loading of entries using REST if you copy config.dist.hson into config.hson and configure
 a valid thethings.io token.
